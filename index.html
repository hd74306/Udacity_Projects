        <h1>Jenkins Continuous Integration Tool</h1>

        <b>Using the Jenkins build server</b>
        <p>Continuous integration is a process in which all development work
          is integrated as early as possible. The resulting artifacts are
          automatically created and tested. This process allows to identify
          errors as early as possible.Jenkins is a popular open source tool to
          perform <b><em>continuous integration</em></b> and build automation.
          The basicfunctionality of Jenkins is to execute a predefined list of
          steps,<br>
          e.g. to compile Java source code and build a JAR from the resulting
          classes. The trigger for this execution can be time or event based.
          For example, every 20 minutes or after a new commit in a Git
          repository.

        <b>Installation and setup of Jenkins</b>
        <p>For most platforms you have native packages,
          see the <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins Homepage</a>
        </p>

        <b>Installing of the Jenkins server on Ubuntu</b>
        <p>Jenkins provides Debian/Ubuntu packages which install Jenkins and
           register Jenkins as start service. See the Install Jenkins on Ubunt
           description The Linux installation creates a /etc/init.d/jenkins
           script which starts Jenkins automatically at boot time.<br>
           <br>
           Jenkins stores all the settings, logs and build artifacts in its
           home directory. The default installation directory is
           /var/lib/jenkins under Ubuntu.
